                        Realtor insights provides tools to help individuals make more informed purchasing decisions when looking for their next home.
                        Created as part of ESC472 - Electrical and Computer Capstone Design course at the University of Toronto, this application provides 
                        an opportunity to integrate and apply the technical knowledge gained during the team's undergraduate education to the solution 
                        of a given real-world engineering design challenge.

                        Assessor aims to provide a research tool for individuals interested in finding a new home that considers an individualâ€™s wants and needs 
                        at a level of granularity down to the neighborhood or district level. The tool is build on three machine learning models: Personal Fit, 
                        which classifies the individual with respect to demographics of each district; Public Perception, which determines the general 
                        sentiment about each district based on news and social media; and Financial Opportunity, which provides a forecasted valuation of the district 
                        based on historical data.
